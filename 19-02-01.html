        <h2>Weird Word Origins</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the always wonderful, sometimes weird, and often downright wacky world of word histories
            </p>

                    Never thought you’d hear adjectives such as <i>wacky</i> and <i>weird</i> associated with the history of words? Think again, oh soon-to-be-even-wiser-than-you-are-now reader! The study of word origins isn’t about memorizing technical terms or resurrecting dead languages or puzzling over parts of speech. Instead, it’s all about telling stories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The history of a word is a narrative, plain and simple: where the word began, how it changed over time, and how it got where it is today. Delightfully, these narratives are often full of plot twists, turning points, heroes and villains, and surprise endings.
