        <h2>Shortening</h2>
            <div>
            The <b>shortening</b> process is based mostly on a kind of linguistic laziness called <b>clipping</b> that causes us to lop off great chunks of words. For example, we end up with <i>fridge</i> from <i>refrigerator</i> and <em>flu</em> from <i>influenza</i>. Often we clip everything after the first syllable: <i>dis</i> (from <i>disrespect</i>) and <i>gym</i> (from <i>gymnasium</i>).
            </div>
            <div>
            A related process is the creation of <b>acronyms</b>, which form a pronounceable word using the first letters of each word in a phrase. For example, <i>UNICEF</i> from United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, and <i>NATO</i> from North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
