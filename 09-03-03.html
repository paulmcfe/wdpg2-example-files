            Many designers are against using borders anywhere on a page. Why? Mostly because they see borders as a crutch to help prop up an otherwise poor design. In their view, if a site is properly laid out, borders are superfluous because the content is already well-organized and easy to understand.

                Other designers view borders as just another CSS tool that, like all CSS properties, can be used poorly or to good effect. In the end, there is no right or wrong when it comes to borders. Some sites need them, some sites don’t, and it’s a wise desgner who can tell the difference.
