                Metaphors for New Words

                “Because in our brief lives we catch so little of the vastness of history, we tend too much to think of language as being solid as a dictionary, with a granite-like permanence, rather than as the rampant restless sea of metaphor which it is.”<br>–Julian Jaynes

            <div id="section-summary">
                We make metaphors for many things, but when we make many metaphors for one thing, it says that thing is important to us. We make metaphors for new words almost as readily as we make new words.
